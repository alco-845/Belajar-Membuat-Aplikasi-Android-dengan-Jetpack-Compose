Also, playing in a tier I ship, you will never come across anything but other tier Is. That being said, tier I ships don’t have enough differences for it to really matter. I put the Hermelin on top though, because it’s fast, and it shoots fast. Being a little faster makes it a lot more fun to play compared to the others, which feel like they broke down and now you have to paddle them.",

Focusing on guns while having plenty of torpedoes to back them up, American destroyers will bully others off of capture points if not outright kill them. They also have some of the best smoke in the game which is great for supporting your team.",

The St. Louis moves very slow but is actually able to fight battleships pretty easily with how much firepower St. Louis has. In higher tiers, the low maneuverability would be a huge downside to just about any cruiser but in tier III it honestly doesn’t matter.",

The main thing making them so strong is high fire chance, but they have pretty good guns in general and pretty thick armor too. Oh yeah, and they have the strongest heal in the game which can refill up to about 50% of your missing health at higher tiers. The fire chance is a big deal because battleships especially are hard to deal damage to so lighting a couple fires is the safest way do kill them. And the maybe the most annoying way for them to die.",

Although her armor is lacking, kongo got a big health pool and enough range that you shouldn’t be getting hit too often. Kongo is a fan favorite and for good reason, if your goal with a battleship is to deal a lot of damage instead of take a lot, you’ll enjoy the Japanese line and definitely the Kongo.",

Since the Americans have been winning out most destroyer spots because of their guns, it shouldn’t come as much of a surprise why the Gaede is here. The light cruiser sized guns and a bigger health pool causes this to be more like a “very light cruiser” that also has some nice torpedoes with good range. Gaede still has the option to use destroyer sized guns and the versatility makes for a fun ship.",

And that means, richelieu will rarely give an angle that you can effectively do any damage against. richelieu also has long range, and high speed.
